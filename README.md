# BergToNotion
Python script to scrap hikes from bergtour-online.de into a beautiful notion table

# Configuration
For making the script work you must create a new integration with read, update and insert permission. Afterwards, simply replace the variables *secret_key* with your integration secret key and *page_id* with the id of the page where you want to create the table.

Thanks for giving it a look and feel free to participate :)
